# Introduction

"Poplloon" arose from a spontaneous inspiration triggered by a series of events in my personal life, leading to the conception of an innovative product within the saturated market of hyper-casual mobile games, with a unique and meaningful focus: accessibility for those affected by color deficiency, commonly known as color blindness.

The core gameplay concept was simple: popping colored balloons that appeared on the screen, with the twist that players were given an indication of which color to touch for points. 

However, if they touched the wrong color, they would be penalized.

In addition to this fundamental mechanic, the game featured additional elements such as obtaining power-ups and the appearance of plush toys tied to the balloons, providing a visually appealing aesthetic particularly suitable for the younger audience.

Unlike many games in the market, "Poplloon" didn't focus on player competition for the highest score but rather on providing a relaxing and enjoyable experience where players could enjoy at their own pace, without limits or external pressures.

Through this post-mortem, we will reflect on the achievements made, the challenges faced, and the lessons learned during "Poplloon's" journey towards creating an accessible and relaxing game for all.
